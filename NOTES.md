## Just some random thoughts on "maybe" a game

### Game would allow to hunt for treasures

Deep in the Dark Woods of Malice there are vast treasures just waiting for you, bold treasure hunter. Go and venture without fear, and you will be rewarded or ... you will die with grouesome death!
Just kidding ;)

#### Some ideas on TODOs

- [x] add points depending on treasure value
- [x] you can move cursor above trees, click to cut tree
- [ ] timer
- [x] add random number of treasures
- [ ] add ability to cut rows at once
- [ ] add ability to cut squares at once
- [ ] animate rows/squares you are going to cut

- [ ] maybe add monsters and hazards that will take away your points ;)
- [ ] maybe: you can move untill you spend all points, after that you are able to cut one tree per x time
- [ ] ⛏️ - mining pick - maybe some stones in the woods, so you can crush them for diamonds?

#### styling

- [ ] add wall on the top of screen
